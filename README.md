## Project Outline

The goal of our **Dog Registry Application** is to increase the confidence of dog owners in the genetic history of their dogs while supporting responsible breeders, veterinarians, and sales agreements.

 The **[American Kennel Club](https://www.akc.org/)** has maintained a registry of pure breed dogs since 1884 as a means of maintaining the integrity of breed lineages and the integrity of those involved in **dog breeding**. The AKC is an advocate for pure breed dog ownership, canine health, and promotion of responsible **dog ownership** and breeding. Currently, the AKC maintains paper and electronic breed records that are held incen tral authority. Persons who wish to breed their dogs must pay **fees to register** the sire, the dame, and the resulting litter of puppies. Further fees are paid for registration of **health**, **genetics**, **sale**, and **ownership**. Each certification is held separately, fees are charged to access each record. See: https://www.akc.org/register/.
 
## Benefits of using our Dapp Vs. Centralized Registry Dog applications

The application that we have developed uses **smart contracts** and **blockchain** technology to verify and store dog registry data on a blockchain contract. 

Benefits of using a decentralized application (DAPP) compared to traditional dog registries: 
- **Verify** dog breed lineage easily
- **Prevent fraud** activities
- Improve **transparancy**
- **Realtime** accounting
- **Cost reduction** for registrations
- **Imutability**
- **Decentralized** ledger accessible to the public
- Increased **trust** in record keeping
- **Programable** sytstem

The registry dapp tracks a puppy from broker to new owner in a single, immortal, blockchain smart contract that is accessable to all key actors in the process. For each litter the blockchain record has **relavent identities**, **certifications** and information (Figure 1). The broker or kennel club, certifys a veterinarian, and buyer/ owner are also recorded along with the certifications given by each entity. 

This blockchain application introduces a heretofore unprecedented level of transparency to dog breeding and increases the confidence of dog owners in the veracity of breeding information while supporting responsible **breeders**, **veterinarians**, and **brokers**.

## How our application works

This application `app.py` is a **front end** that allows you to interact with a **back end** smart contract deployed on an **ethereum test network**.

### Step 1: Preparation steps before testing the dapp locally

1. Set up **Ganache** for a blockchain environment
2. Import ganache account to your **metamask** using the provided **private keys**
3. Import **`DogNFT.sol`** and **`DogRegistry.sol`** to **Remix IDE**
4. Compile and Deploy `DogRegistry.sol`  using **injected provider** metamask for your environment on Remix IDE
5. Copy the **deployed** smart contract address into your `.env` environment
6. Add Pinata API keys to `.env` file. 

> **Note**
Use **SAMPLE.env** file as a template and change the file name from `SAMPLE.env` to `.env` after adding your **Pinata API key** and deployed contract address.

### Step 2: Running the application

Make sure you still have ganache open and running and proceed to run the **`app.py`** application. 

The application requires **streamlit** so if you don't have it installed, use `pip install streamlit` to **install** from your Terminal and then proceed.

Use **Terminal** to `cd` into the `dog-registry-blockchain-app/` directory and use streamlit to run the `app.py` with the following command.

```
streamlit run app.py
```

### Step 3: Navigating through the app

Use the **select accounts** on the sidebar panel to select the account that will be executing function calls on the smart contract. 

- Step 1 : **Add Broker**
    - The contract deployer can assign a broker role account by calling the `addBroker` to add broker address and a broker Id
    - The broker role has the ability to add a veterinary doctor by calling the `addVeterinaryDoctor` function
    - The broker role has the ability to add a dog breeder by calling the `addDogBreeder` function
    - To check if an address is a broker call `isBroker` and provide an ethereum address
- Step 2: **Add Veterinary Doctor**
    - Only addresses with a broker role can add a new veterinary doctor by calling `addVeterinaryDoctor` function
    - The Veterinary doctor is the only role that can add a health report for a reigstered puppy by calling `addPuppyReport` function
    - To check if an address is a veterinary doctor call `isVeterinaryDoctor` and provide an ethereum address
- Step 3: **Add Dog Breeder**
    - The broker role is the only role that can add a dog breeder by calling `addDogBreeder` function
    - The dog breeder role has the ability to register a puppy by calling `registerDog` or `addDog` functions
    - To check if an address is a dog breeder call `isDogBreeder` and provide an ethereum address
- Step 4: **Register Dog**
    - Only addresses with a dog breeder role can call `registerDog` to register a puppy. 
    - To register Dog provide a `dog_owner` address, `name`, `breed`, `dame`, `sire`, `initialAppraisalValue`, `litterID`, `litterSize`, `birthDate`, then upload an `image` on the front end to generate a `tokenURI` and `tokenJSON` uploaded through pinata ipfs. 
    - The `registerDog` is a function from [Dog NFT smart contract](./contracts/DogNFT.sol) smart contract to register a dog via an ERC721 NFT token
    - Produces an NFT for the puppy.
        - The owner recieves a **non-fungible token** (NFT) unique to their new dog along with access to the breeding and health records.
- Step 5: **Add Puppy Health Records**
    - A veterinary doctor role can add puppy health record by calling `addPuppyReport` function
    - The front end provides inputs to call the contract funtion via text inputs
- Step 6: **Appraise Dog**
    - Only addresses assigned a token id belonging to a puppy NFT can appraise the the puppy's value by calling `Appraisal` function
    - The front end provide an input for a token ID, new appraisal amount and details for the appraisal report
    - There is also a funtion `ownerOf` that takes in a token Id `uint` value to check the current owner of the NFT DOG token
- Step 7: **Get the appraisal report History**
    - The front end application provides one `uint` input for a token ID
    - When you click the 'get appraisal report' button, we a checking for contract events from the `Appraisal` function
    - We are also using the token ID as a filter by adding `.createFilter` to get the appraisal reports for the token

When you complete all the steps you should be able to view the NFT of the **DOG token** like shown in the figure below.

## Improvements

- Create **marketplace** functionalities for our dog registry system
    - Our next feature would be to add a marketplace to conduct sales for registered puppies
    - Add functionalities to bid for NFT tokens

## Project Challenges

- Setting up smart contracts to work with our idea
    - Problems with struct having too many variables giving **"Stack too deep"** solidity error. 
        - Cleared the error by reducing amounts of variable used
    - Implementing NFTs to our project 
    - Implementing a trading capabilities to our dog NFTs
- Getting project done within a short period of time
- Splitting project work load with team members
